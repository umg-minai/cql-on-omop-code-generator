## Introduction

The repository contains a code generator that consumes a CSV-formatted description of the [OMOP Clinical Data Model (CDM)](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/) and produces code artifacts that can be used with the [reference implementation](https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language) of the [Clinical Query Language (CQL)](https://cql.hl7.org/).
The generated code in combination with hand-written glue-code allows the CQL engine to process clinical data which is stored in an SQL database system and conforms to the OMOP CDM.
